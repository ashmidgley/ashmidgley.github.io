    <p>Tech journey so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>2013: Got dragged along to a Victoria University Robotics club by a good friend. Was fascinated by how the guys could control what the robot was doing by changing a few lines of this strange language called Robot C. Went home and changed my university application from a Commerce degree to Computer Science.</li>
<li>2014: Undergraduate begins. Introductory courses in Python and Java.</li>
<li>2015: Advanced Java + introduction to C.</li>
<li>2016: Comp Sci hell paper (COSC326), app development in Swift, some networking and a sprinkling of computer graphics to finish off my studies.</li>
<li>2017: Grad role in the &lsquo;Application Support&rsquo; team at a corporate product shop in Wellington. Start to pickup web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) and learn how large applications are built with the .NET framework.</li>
<li>2018: Transition to &lsquo;Modern Applications&rsquo; team. Spend majority of time working with Azure CI/CD pipelines.</li>
<li>2019: Quit, up sticks and move to the UK. After some time off, land a role at a startup in Liverpool as a full stack developer. Learn a bunch about API design, frontend development and TDD.</li>
<li>2020: Move back to New Zealand due to COVID. Continue working remotely for TCW until end of year.</li>
<li>2021: &hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>My main programming languages are: Go, C# and JavaScript. My IDE of choice is VSCode although I quite enjoy using Vim here and there as well.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not tinkering with stuff on the computer you&rsquo;ll find me at the BJJ gym, checking out gigs in Welly or <a href="https://bookshelf.co.nz/shelf/1">reading</a>.</p>

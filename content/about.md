Tech journey so far:
- 2013: Got dragged along to a Victoria University Robotics club by a good friend. Was fascinated by how the guys could control what the robot was doing by changing a few lines of this strange language called Robot C. Went home and changed my university application from a Commerce degree to Computer Science.
- 2014: Undergraduate begins. Introductory courses in Python and Java.
- 2015: Advanced Java + introduction to C.
- 2016: Comp Sci hell paper (COSC326), app development in Swift, some networking and a sprinkling of computer graphics to finish off my studies.
- 2017: Grad role in the 'Application Support' team at a corporate product shop in Wellington. Start to pickup web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) and learn how large applications are built with the .NET framework.
- 2018: Transition to 'Modern Applications' team. Spend majority of time working with Azure CI/CD pipelines.
- 2019: Quit, up sticks and move to the UK. After some time off, land a role at a startup in Liverpool as a full stack developer. Learn a bunch about API design, frontend development and TDD.
- 2020: Move back to New Zealand due to COVID. Continue working remotely for TCW until end of year.
- 2021: ...

My main programming languages are: Go, C# and JavaScript. My IDE of choice is VSCode although I quite enjoy using Vim here and there as well.

When I'm not tinkering with stuff on the computer you'll find me at the BJJ gym, checking out gigs in Welly or [reading](https://bookshelf.co.nz/shelf/1).

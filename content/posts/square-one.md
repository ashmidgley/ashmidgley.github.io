Once again I find myself unemployed and looking for my next role. I'm getting an overwhelming sense of [déjà vu](/posts/pilot).

Although the obvious choice is to apply for another full stack role, I find myself a bit frustrated with the frontend space and unsure if I'm interested in continuing with it professionally: [link](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.6p911en3r), [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/bos684/i_am_a_web_dev_and_i_am_burnt_the_fk_out/). After 4 years I'm also keen to put some distance between myself and C#, MSSQL and Azure. Sorry Microsoft. It's not you, it's me.

The first part of 2021 will be spent digging deeper into Go, PostgreSQL, Google Cloud Platform and CircleCI. It would be nice to document the process so I can laugh about how little I know in 2 years time.

Goodbye 2020. It's been strange, but also fun in a 'working in my pajamas, watching sickening amounts of Netflix and experimenting with a beard' sort of way.

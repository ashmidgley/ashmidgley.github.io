Yeah, yeah I know it's been a while since my last one. Bite me. I spent the last few weeks reading the fourth edition of [C# In Depth](https://csharpindepth.com/) by Jon Skeet. 

For those not familiar with C#, I'll give you a short history. It's a programming language that was released sometime in 2000 by Microsoft. It was originally supposed to be called "Cool" (C-like Object Oriented Language). The creators of Java, which was released in 1994, quickly called C# an imitation of their language. Since then both languages have taken different paths and formed their own style of development. I'm not going to try and convince you that either one is better than the other because I believe that taking the time to learn one object-oriented language in depth will mean you can transfer majority of that knowledge across to another OO language. Fine, you caught me. I can feel you drilling me with those judgemental little eyes so I'll admit that's not the real reason. I assume there's some serious babes out there who program in Java and I don't want to go burning any bridges.

Currently it's sitting in 4th place in terms of language popularity.

Jon Skeet is a software engineer at Google in London providing .NET client libraries for Google Cloud Platform. More importantly, he's the number one contributor on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). That time you were still at the office at 6:30pm but managed to find a solution to your problem on stoverflow and make it home for dinner. That was Jon. That guy who jumped into that burning building and saved those orphans. Yeah, that was Jon. If Jon needed a kidney I'd give him one. Hell, if he needed 2 he could have both.

The book steps through versions 2-7 of C# giving you the low down on what was introduced and why. The final chapter discusses what he thinks will be in C# 8. This is because the fourth edition was written prior to C# 8's release in September. The first run through can be a bit chewy, but I promise that if you push through and finish the sacred text working with C# will become a lot more fun.

Over the next few weeks I'll be covering the most useable features introduced in versions 2 through 7.

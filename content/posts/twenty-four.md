Heya how are ya? Okay that's enough out of you. Let's talk about me. November was busy. After months of putting it off I finally refactored my CV. I spent early November eyeing up jobs before passed it out and then DUN DUN DUNNNNN... interview time. To prepare for these I spent some quality time on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/top-interview-questions) cracking basic algorithms and rewriting my API tests in [nunit](https://github.com/ashmidgley/bookshelf-api/tree/master/Bookshelf.Tests).

In comparison to my graduate level interviews the sessions were a lot more relaxed. We just yarned about a mix of techy stuff and my background rather than ticking off the standard questions passed on from HR (what colour would you describe yourself as?). I was kinda dreading the coding tests but the two that I had actually ended up being pretty fun. 

Interview #1: Given an image retrieval function in a .NET web app, write a caching service and tests.

I didn't get it initially, but the fella's gave me hints along the way.

Interview #2: Given a school database with tables relevant to classes, teachers, students etc write a stored procedure to pull specific data for each class. Next build a web API to pull the data from the stored proc. Finally create some views to display the data in a readable fashion. You have an hour and a half to complete the tasks.

I ran out of time part way into the last task.

All in all pretty happy with the process. I landed a spot at a startup in Liverpool and start on Monday. Proper clued up dev team who are doing some groovy stuff with [Hangfire](https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire). It's looking like I'll be diving deeper into C#/.NET and Angular as well as dipping my toes in some Azure stuff here and there. Hunky dory on my end.

I've taken some time off coding. A few months back I quit my job and made the move across to the UK. Since then I've spent alot of time drinking tea, putting back Curly Wurly's and complaining about the weather. Sadly, funds are starting to run dry. This means it's time to get back on the horse and gradually prepare for programming tests and technical interviews.

Thinking about revising data structures and algorithms is enough to spark anxiety in the bravest of computer science graduates so I figured writing about what I learn over the next few months will help keep me on track.

TLDR: Welcome to my blog.
